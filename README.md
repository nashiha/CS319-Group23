# Project:
Our project is a "Tower Defense" type game. It will be a Java desktop application. 

Tower Defense is a strategy video game. In Tower Defense games, players aim to defend their territories or possessions from enemies by placing obstacles in their path or destroying them before the reach the endpoint. Popular Tower Defense games include "Missile Command," "Plants vs. Zombies," and "Kingdom Rush." Our CS319 project uses this idea for inspiration. 

In our game, there are separate "waves" of monsters with distinct powers and lifespans that try to reach the end point. By placing obstacles in their path, the player tries to prevent the monsters from reaching the endpoint. These obstacles can be towers with special powers that kill the monsters passing by them. Each tower has a separate price and the player can only earn money by killing enemies. The player will have a fixed amount of money at the beginning of every level. The player will also have a lifespan. It decreases after enemies pass the end point. If the player is still alive after all the waves, the player wins.
